== Sample Application

Working with ACLs in Spring Security is complex but it will be easier to understand with a sample application. To help get you started, there's a Grails application that uses the plugin to test with. It's based on the Spring Security https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/master/samples/contacts-xml[Contacts] sample application. But where the Spring Security application uses SpringMVC, JDBC, etc., this application is 100% Grails. The application is available https://github.com/burtbeckwith/grails-contacts[at GitHub].

Clone or fork the repo and start the app:

....
$ grails run-app
....

Open http://localhost:8080/ in a browser to get started. The main functionality is at http://localhost:8080/secure. The login page lists the various configured users and their passwords; the "rod" user is an admin and has full access and the other users have various grants and ownership.
